1. Image Classification
MNIST Dataset:

Why: MNIST is great for testing kernel functions, as linear SVMs struggle with its nonlinear structure, while RBF and polynomial kernels perform much better.
Use case: Experiment with linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels on digit classification. Compare convergence rates and accuracy using optimization techniques like dual formulation or SMO.
Format: 70,000 grayscale images of size 28x28 (10 classes).
Fashion-MNIST:

Why: Similar to MNIST but more challenging, with fashion-related classes like shirts and shoes. It's a step up from MNIST in complexity.
Use case: Test how kernel functions behave on slightly more realistic image data.
Format: Same as MNIST (70,000 grayscale images, 10 classes).
2. Text Classification
20 Newsgroups Dataset:

Why: It has text data suitable for linear and RBF kernels. Text data often works well with linear kernels but can benefit from polynomial kernels for complex relationships.
Use case: Compare the efficiency of linear and nonlinear kernels for multi-class classification of topics. Use optimization techniques like SMO for high-dimensional sparse data.
Format: 18,000 text documents with 20 categories.
IMDB Sentiment Dataset:

Why: Binary classification problem for sentiment analysis. Provides an opportunity to test kernel effectiveness on word vector embeddings or TF-IDF features.
Use case: Use linear and RBF kernels to classify reviews as positive or negative.
3. Tabular Classification
Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset:

Why: Binary classification problem with numerical features. Itâ€™s good for testing kernel functions as the data might exhibit linear and nonlinear relationships.
Use case: Apply linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels. Compare the performance of optimization methods like dual optimization vs. SGD.
Format: 30 features, 569 samples.
Wine Quality Dataset:

Why: Multi-class classification problem. Ideal for analyzing kernel differences in a dataset with mixed feature types.
Use case: Compare kernel performance and optimization speed for predicting wine quality (1-10).
Format: 11 features, ~6,500 samples.
4. Synthetic Datasets
Scikit-learn's Make_Moons and Make_Circles:

Why: These datasets are nonlinear and low-dimensional, which makes them ideal for visualizing SVM boundaries with different kernels.
Use case: Compare kernel behavior visually and experimentally using linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels. Analyze convergence rates with synthetic data.
Format: 2D feature space, customizable number of samples.
Gaussian Clusters (Blobs):

Why: Easy to simulate linear and nonlinear decision boundaries by adjusting cluster spread.
Use case: Explore kernel performance under controlled conditions.
Suggested Dataset Combinations for Your Project
Use MNIST or Fashion-MNIST for image classification, as they provide a clear example of nonlinear boundaries requiring advanced kernels.
Include a text classification dataset like 20 Newsgroups for testing kernel efficiency in high-dimensional sparse feature spaces.
Add Breast Cancer or Wine Quality for tabular data experiments, as they include both linear and nonlinear structures.
For visualization and analysis, include Make_Moons or Make_Circles, as they allow intuitive understanding of kernel performance.
Experimental Setup Suggestions
Kernel Comparison:

Train SVMs with different kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF, sigmoid) on the datasets.
Measure accuracy, precision/recall, and runtime.
Optimization Techniques:

Implement dual optimization using Lagrange multipliers for a kernel of your choice.
Compare it with a library-based SMO implementation (e.g., scikit-learn).
Analyze convergence rates and training times for small vs. large datasets.
Final Presentation:

Use visualizations like decision boundaries (on synthetic data) and accuracy vs. training iterations.
Report kernel-specific insights and how optimization techniques impact real-world performance.
